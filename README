ToyServer!

2011, Matthew Erickson.

A simple WSGI server for showing you what you're doing with HTTP
clients.  May or may not be accurate representations of proper
HTTP/1.1 or 1.0.

To start, run server.py.  There are two command-line options:

   -a : sets the listening address
   -p : sets the listening port.

Setting the envar TOYSERVER_LOG_DEBUG will increase the logging level.
